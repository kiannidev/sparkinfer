# Changelog

Notable changes to sparkinfer. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com);
versions track the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/gittensor-ai-lab/sparkinfer/releases).

## [0.3.1] — 2026-06-29

The lead over llama.cpp widens to **double digits — and now holds at every context length** — and the
evaluation becomes **publicly verifiable**: a hardware trust model plus an immutable, per-run public log.

### Performance — RTX 5090 frontier 388.68 → 410.85 tok/s (+5.7%); now **10%+ past llama.cpp**
Two verified kernel optimizations merged (top-1 0.97, KL ≈ 0.14):
- **#72** — split-K the router projection GEMV for decode occupancy → 394.45 (@Dexterity104)
- **#83** — emit Q8_1 from the residual RMSNorm, dropping the per-layer activation quantize → 410.85 (@fansilas)

Same RTX 5090, same Q4_K_M GGUF, warm & interleaved vs `llama-bench`:

| decode length | sparkinfer | llama.cpp |   |
|---|---|---|---|
| **128 tok** | **410.2** | 366.0 | **+12.1%** |
| **256 tok** | **402.2** | 365.8 | **+10.0%** |
| **512 tok** | **386.6** | 362.5 | **+6.7%** |

sparkinfer is now **ahead at every length** — v0.3.0 was ~parity at 512; the recent decode-path work
(residual Q8_1, router split-K) lifted the long-context number too.

### Added — trustless, publicly-verifiable evaluation
- **[`EVAL-TRUST.md`](EVAL-TRUST.md)** — the eval trust model: **reproducible from source today**, the
  attested-eval roadmap (CPU-TEE scoring receipts → multi-validator consensus), and the honest boundary
  (a consumer RTX 5090 has **no GPU Confidential Computing**, so the speed number is trusted via
  **reproduction + consensus**, not a GPU enclave — by design, since we optimize the hardware people own).
- **[sparkinfer-log](https://github.com/gittensor-ai-lab/sparkinfer-log)** — every eval is now committed
  **immutably** to a public repo (raw `log.txt` + `result.json`, host IPs scrubbed) and rendered at a
  **unique, verifiable URL per run** (GitHub Pages). The dashboard links each verdict to its proof.

### Changed — accuracy gate tightened
- **KL hard-reject at 0.20** (preferred ≤ 0.15): a speedup that erodes parity with llama.cpp now
  `REJECT`s regardless of tok/s. In practice #83 first regressed KL to 0.21 → `REJECT`, the author
  reworked it to KL 0.14 → clean `S` → merged. The gate forced a better PR.

### Fixed — eval stability
- **Warm-up before the baseline**, **fresh same-box checkout** on reused boxes (`FETCH_HEAD`, not a
  stale `origin/main`), and a **baseline sanity guard** — so cold clocks and stale builds can't skew a
  verdict.

### Verified
- **RTX 5090** frontier **410.85 tok/s** (128-tok), top-1 **0.97** vs llama.cpp (KL ≈ 0.14) —
  **+12.1% @128 / +10.0% @256 / +6.7% @512** over llama.cpp, same-box, warm, interleaved.

### Contributors
- **@fansilas** — #83 (emit Q8_1 from the residual RMSNorm)
- **@Dexterity104** — #72 (split-K router projection GEMV)

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-28

The milestone release: sparkinfer's CUDA kernels **overtake llama.cpp** on Qwen3-MoE single-stream
decode — at the **kernel level**, same model, same Q4_K_M precision, same greedy `bs=1` decode. No
speculative decoding (EAGLE-3 / Medusa), no draft model, no flash-decoding accuracy trade — just
faster kernels. Plus the first **production-readiness** feature: a thermal-safe inference governor.

### Performance — RTX 5090 frontier 313.14 → 388.68 tok/s (+24%)
Four verified kernel optimizations merged (top-1 0.95–0.98 vs llama.cpp, KL ≈ 0.145):
- **#71** — int8 dp4a MMVQ for the Q4_K MoE down projection → 333.75 (@Dexterity104)
- **#74** — split-K MMVQ down for M-tier decode occupancy → 339.59 (@jaso0n0818)
- **#76** — fuse per-head Q/K-norm + Q/K rope into single kernels → 371.27 (@James-CUDA)
- **#73** — skip the unused per-expert token-count pass in single-token decode → 388.68 (@Dexterity104)

### 🏁 First to beat llama.cpp — at the kernel level
Same RTX 5090, same Qwen3-30B-A3B Q4_K_M GGUF, head-to-head vs `llama-bench`, warm & controlled:

| decode length | sparkinfer | llama.cpp |   |
|---|---|---|---|
| **128 tok** | **388.7** | 372.0 | **+4.5%** |
| 256 tok | 381.5 | 371.7 | +2.6% |
| 512 tok | 367.3 | 368.6 | ~parity |

A **genuine kernel win** — identical weights, precision, and greedy single-stream decode; the
speedup lives in the CUDA kernels (fused quantized MoE FFN, int8 dp4a MMVQ across every decode GEMV,
split-K occupancy, fused attention norms), **not** in algorithmic shortcuts. The lead is largest at
short generations and narrows to parity at long context — the per-token attention/KV path is the
next frontier.

### Added — production-readiness: thermal-safe inference (#77, @ai-hpc)
- **`ThermalGovernor`** — a DVFS-style decode governor that throttles **throughput** when the GPU
  runs hot (turbo / balanced / safe / emergency tiers, predictive), **preserving correctness
  exactly**: it only paces token emission and never touches weights, precision, logits, or sampling,
  so output is **bit-identical** to an un-paced run. Opt-in; zero overhead when off. Forcing the
  tiers on a real RTX 5090 traded throughput for power **309 W → 87 W (3.5×)** with *identical token
  ids* across every mode.
- **GPU observability** — engine-level `query_gpu_stats()` / `Runtime::gpu_stats()` (heat, VRAM,
  power, SM clock via NVML, mapped to the CUDA device by PCI bus id).

### Changed — evaluation hardened against thermal & caching effects
- **Warm-up before the baseline.** The from-source build leaves the GPU idle for minutes, so the
  first timed build (the same-box baseline) was read on **cold clocks** and inflated every PR's
  delta. The bench now spins clocks to boost before timing.
- **Fresh same-box baseline on reused boxes.** The baseline checkout ran `git fetch origin origin/main`
  — which silently fails (the branch is `main`) — and on a **reused** box left a *stale* checkout, so
  it built **pre-merge** code and a just-merged gain was double-counted into the next PRs. Now it
  fetches the real branch and checks out `FETCH_HEAD` (guaranteed fresh).
- **Baseline sanity guard.** A run aborts if the same-box `main` baseline reads < 90 % of the known
  frontier (cold / throttling / degraded box) instead of grading against a bogus-low baseline.

### Verified
- **RTX 5090** frontier **388.68 tok/s** (128-tok decode), top-1 **0.98** vs llama.cpp (KL ≈ 0.145),
  **21.4 GB** resident — **+4.5 % over llama.cpp** at 128-tok, ~parity at 512-tok. Same-box, warm,
  llama-anchored, controlled measurement.

### Contributors
- **@Dexterity104** — #71 (int8 dp4a Q4_K MoE down), #73 (skip per-expert token count)
- **@jaso0n0818** — #74 (split-K MMVQ down)
- **@James-CUDA** — #76 (fuse Q/K-norm + Q/K rope)
- **@ai-hpc** — #77 (thermal governor + GPU observability)

## [0.2.3] — 2026-06-26

A performance jump **and** a fairer, more trustworthy evaluation: every PR is now measured against
`main` on the **same GPU**, scored on the same-box delta, and worked through a per-round merge
workflow that can auto-merge the winner.

### Performance — RTX 5090 frontier 285.32 → 313.14 tok/s (+9.7%)
Two verified MMVQ int8 quantized-read optimizations merged (top-1 0.99 vs llama.cpp, KL ≈ 0.15):
- **#65** — int8 dp4a MMVQ for the Q6_K MoE down projection → 291.58 (@bohdansolovie)
- **#70** — int8 MMVQ for the last fp32-path GEMVs (attn-V + LM head + gate/up) → 313.14 (@James-CUDA)

The llama.cpp gap closed to **0.86×** (313.14 vs 365.73 tok/s).

### Changed — fairer, hardware-independent scoring
- **Same-box baseline.** Each eval builds **current `main` and the PR on the same RTX 5090** and
  scores the **delta between them**, so speed differences between eval machines can't inflate or
  hide a result. (Previously a PR's tok/s was compared to a frontier measured on a *different* box.)
- **No within-run ratchet — independent PRs each score.** Every queued PR is graded against `main`,
  not against the other PRs in the run. Before, whichever PR was graded first ratcheted the frontier
  and made the next — a *different* optimization — look like `eval:none`.
- **Label tiers are now bands of % over the frontier** (`XS` 2–3.5% … `XL` >18%), so all five stay
  reachable as decode speed grows (the old fraction-of-headroom rule collapsed the small tiers).

### Added — per-round merge workflow (+ guarded auto-merge)
- A round grades the whole queue against the same `main`, labels the biggest verified speedup
  **`merge-first`** and the rest **`needs-rebase`**. After the winner merges, rivals **rebase onto
  the new `main`** and the bot re-evaluates them for their *marginal* gain on top — so independent
  wins stack and an overlapping one correctly drops to `none` (`re-evaluate` tags the re-grade).
- **Auto-merge (opt-in, heavily guarded).** The `merge-first` winner auto-merges only with a verified
  speedup, no `copycat`/`flagged:gaming`/`penalty`/`hold`, author in good standing, changes confined
  to `kernels`/`runtime`/`moe`, clean CI, and no conflicts. A `hold` label or `SPARKINFER_AUTOMERGE=0`
  stops it; branch protection is still enforced.

### Fixed
- **Dashboard journey is merged-only.** The frontier and the optimization journey advance only when a
  PR is **merged** (by its measured tok/s), not on eval — so unmerged or losing-rival evals no longer
  pollute the chart.
- **Self-healing eval box.** Stopped vast.ai boxes get reclaimed, so the pinned box can vanish between
  runs; the bot now reuses it if it survived, else provisions a fresh one (Google Drive model fetch)
  immediately and re-pins — no wasted retries.

### Verified
- **RTX 5090** frontier **313.14 tok/s**, top-1 0.99 vs llama.cpp (KL ≈ 0.15 nats), 21.4 GB resident.
  Auto-evaluation runs on a 2-hour schedule.

### Contributors
- **@James-CUDA** — #70 (int8 MMVQ for the fp32-path GEMVs)
- **@bohdansolovie** — #65 (int8 dp4a MMVQ for the Q6_K MoE down)

## [0.2.2] — 2026-06-26

A day of rapid frontier progress (**+52% decode**), a copycat caught gaming the eval, and a
hardened auto-eval pipeline that now runs reliably on a 30-minute schedule.

### Performance — RTX 5090 frontier 187.61 → 285.32 tok/s (+52%) in a day
Five verified speedups landed since v0.2.0, each paid only for its **marginal gain over the
previous frontier** (correctness-gated, top-1 ≥ 96% vs llama.cpp throughout):

| PR | optimization | → frontier | label |
|----|--------------|-----------:|:-----:|
| #44 | vectorized fused RMSNorm (128-bit bf16×8 loads) | 197.22 | `M` |
| #50 | decode dp4a (MMVQ) default + argmax widen | 240.11 | `XL` |
| #52 | two-pass multi-block decode argmax (1 SM → all SMs) | 262.17 | `L` |
| #59 | llama.cpp Q4_K `mul_mat_vec_q` for attention GEMVs | 279.11 | `L` |
| #63 | parallelized flash-decode combine + `n_splits=32` | 285.32 | `M` |

The llama.cpp gap closed to **0.78×** (285.32 vs 365.73 tok/s).

### Security (anti-gaming)
- **Copycat-to-bypass capture + 5-day penalty.** Caught a PR that re-submitted an earlier
  author's diff with a few extra lines bolted on to look original and slip past the eval — the
  diff-containment fingerprint flags these even with cosmetic additions. A first copycat strike
  now **freezes the author's evaluations for 5 days** (`penalty` label, skipped; already-scored
  PRs keep their result); a **2nd strike auto-blocks**. Logged in `.github/copycats.json` /
  `COPYCATS.md`.
- **No manual eval override.** Removed the `force-eval` bypass entirely — every PR is evaluated
  on a real RTX 5090 **only** after it legitimately passes the gate (box ticked **and** a real
  before<after decode table). Nothing skips the benchmark.

### Fixed — stabilized 30-minute auto-evaluation
- **Google Drive model source.** HuggingFace was throttling the 18.6 GB GGUF to ~0.2–5 KB/s on
  many vast.ai hosts (effectively stalled). The eval now fetches it from Google Drive via `gdown`
  (measured **20–74 MB/s**), with HF/curl as fallback — the model lands in minutes, not never.
- **Pinned stable instance (reuse-first, never destroy).** The eval reuses one known-good box
  with the cached model by default instead of provisioning fresh each run. On bring-up failure it
  retries on the next run (~30 min) up to twice before provisioning a new box — and **never
  destroys the pinned one**. Eliminates the re-download / re-provision churn between runs.
- **Dud-host skip-list + cron lock.** Blacklist hosts whose entire network is dead (not just HF);
  a `flock` lock prevents overlapping cron ticks. Together these make the 30-minute auto-eval reliable.
- **Dashboard.** Optimization-journey x-axis labels rotated 45° so the (now 12) bars no longer collide.

### Changed
- **Label tiers are now bands of % speedup over the frontier** (`XS` 2–3.5%, `S` 3.5–6%, `M` 6–10%,
  `L` 10–18%, `XL` >18%; <2% is within noise → `none`) — same denominator as the significance gate.
  The previous *fraction-of-headroom* rule collapsed `XS`/`S` once the frontier neared the ceiling
  (the 2% noise floor alone exceeded their headroom bands); the new bands keep all five tiers
  reachable and scale with decode speed.

### Verified
- **RTX 5090** frontier **285.32 tok/s**, top-1 0.96 vs llama.cpp (KL ≈ 0.14 nats), 21.4 GB resident.

### Contributors
- **@James-CUDA** — #50 (`XL`), #59 (`L`), #63 (`M`)
- **@kiannidev** — #44 (`M`), #52 (`L`)

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-25

Evaluation-pipeline hardening, anti-gaming controls, and the live frontier dashboard.

### Added
- **Opt-in RTX 5090 evaluation** — the PR auto-eval bot runs the on-device eval only after the
  PR template's *Tested on RTX 5090* box is ticked (auto-applies `test-on-5090`) or a maintainer
  greenlights it; otherwise the PR is labeled `not-tested` and skipped (no GPU). Falsely ticking
  the box is treated as gaming.
- **Live optimization-journey chart** on the [dashboard](https://gittensor-ai-lab.github.io/sparkinfer/dashboard/)
  — recorded passes (history) plus optimizations that have **landed** on the frontier; the bot
  appends each frontier-advancing merge automatically. Accuracy (token-match / KL) now tracks the
  frontier instead of a stale manual value.
- **Community safety hardening** (merged PRs) — input/scratch bounds guards across the MoE expert
  FFN, decode runner, and router kernel; GGUF load-time validation (reject unsupported GGML types,
  clamp invalid `general.alignment`, bounds-check tensor regions vs file size).

### Security (anti-gaming)
- **Sensitive-path merge gate** — `CODEOWNERS` + a `sensitive-paths-guard` status check + branch
  protection block any non-maintainer PR touching the eval/scoring/governance paths (`eval/`,
  `bench/scripts/`, `.gittensor/`, `dashboard/data.json`, `.github/`). The bot also grades with
  `bench/scripts` pinned to `origin/main`, so a PR cannot grade itself.
- **Contributor denylist + auto-block** — `.github/blocked-contributors.txt` (+ `FLAGGED.md`
  evidence log); the bot flags, comments, closes, and skips eval for any PR whose opener or commit
  author/committer is blocked. First entry: a 2-account sybil pair sharing one git identity.
- **Copycat detection** — diff-fingerprint each PR against earlier ones; ≥80% containment of a
  *different* author's earlier diff → `copycat` label, skipped eval, logged to `.github/copycats.json`;
  2 strikes auto-blocks the author.

### Changed
- PRs are evaluated **oldest-first**, so the original of any duplicate is graded before its copy.
- Dashboard: removed the obsolete **emission-weights** panel (scoring is speedup-only — there is no
  per-subsystem budget).

### Fixed (evaluation pipeline)
- Provisioning self-heals: abandon phantom-`running` hosts in ~2 min, retry across hosts, blacklist
  repeat offenders, and survive SSH drops during the 17 GB model download (nohup + resumable fetch).
- Build: pin `g++-12` as the CUDA host compiler (nvcc vs Ubuntu 24.04 GCC 13.3 `cstdio` break);
  cap `-j2` to avoid OOM on 64 GB eval boxes.
- A submission that does not compile now yields a clean `eval:REJECT` instead of an infra error.
- **Force-clean per-PR checkout** — each PR builds its own commit (a stale-checkout bug had graded
  several PRs against the wrong code).
- Labels/comments applied via the GitHub REST API (the GraphQL path silently failed on a
  deprecation warning).

### Verified
- **RTX 5090** frontier ratcheted to **187.61 tok/s** (PDL decode; #8, `eval:L`), **top-1 98%**
  token agreement vs llama.cpp (KL ≈ 0.14 nats).

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/gittensor-ai-lab/sparkinfer/releases/tag/v0.2.0

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-22

First release of the consolidated **sparkinfer** monorepo (kernels + MoE engine + runtime + benchmarks).

### Added
- **Native GGUF loading** — mmap parser + on-GPU **byte-exact Q4_K / Q6_K dequant**;
  expert weights kept quantized resident (Q4_K_M-sized footprint, not bf16).
- **Qwen3-MoE runtime** — embed → RMSNorm → QKV → per-head QK-norm → RoPE → paged GQA
  flash-decode → routed top-k MoE (+ optional shared expert) → LM head → greedy decode.
- **Kernels** — flash-decode (hd128/256/512), **flash-decoding (KV-split)** attention,
  **fused quantized MoE expert FFN** (dequant only the routed experts on-read), decode
  GEMV (coalesced `[out,in]`), GEMM, fused RMSNorm, RoPE.
- **CUDA-graph decode** — the per-token compute is captured once and replayed.
- **Turnkey harness** — `bench/scripts/bench.sh` (decode tok/s, `--compare` vs llama.cpp)
  and `accuracy.sh` (token-match / KL / perplexity); auto-detect arch, fetch model.
- **Accuracy gate** — `qwen3_gguf_score` teacher-forced scorer (per-position argmax +
  top-k logprobs + perplexity), for regression-checking optimizations.
- **Prebuilt binaries** attached to this release (sm_120 / CUDA 13 / glibc 2.39), with
  automatic **source-build fallback** when incompatible.

### Verified
- **RTX 5090** (sm_120, CUDA 13): `ctest` 5/5, compute-sanitizer 0 errors,
  **163.88 tok/s** decode, **100% top-1 token agreement** with llama.cpp (KL ≈ 0.14 nats),
  21.4 GB resident.
- **RTX PRO 6000** (sm_120, CUDA 12.8): **0.60 → 134 tok/s** decode across 6 source-verifiable
  optimization passes.

### Fixed (during RTX 5090 / CUDA 13 bring-up)
- CUDA 13 removed `cudaDeviceProp::memoryClockRate` / `memoryBusWidth` → query via
  `cudaDeviceGetAttribute` (portable across CUDA 12.x / 13).
- Flash-decode scratch (`fa_*`) was NULL on the non-GGUF path (allocated only in
  `load_gguf`) → moved to the constructor (caught by compute-sanitizer).
- Top-level superbuild was missing `enable_testing()` → `ctest` found no tests.

[0.1.0]: https://github.com/gittensor-ai-lab/sparkinfer/releases/tag/v0.1.0
